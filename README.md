Bronze Stage: Getting an application to correctly form a chat structure.  Where a User is capable to send messages like a standard chat application would.  Also need to allow for the chat room to be cleared or deleted.  

Silver Stage: Emoji support, hopefully utilizing an API (Giphy) to allow users to add GIF's.  Also would like to add functionality to image sending features.

Gold Stage: Getting the application to be specific in location.  So that the only way to correctly "log in" the user has to be in a certain location and have the correct web address.
